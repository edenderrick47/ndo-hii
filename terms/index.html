                                <li>We disclaim liability for technical issues that occur during payment processing. If you experience a problem, double-check your information before contacting customer support. You agree to hold us harmless should any glitch occur during your payment, including but not limited to the following, as these factors are outside our control.<br />
                                    <strong>A.</strong> Technical issues between PayPal and your bank or card issuer may prevent transactions from posting.<br />
                                    <strong>B.</strong> Payments made by electronic check (eCheck) take up to 10 days to process, which could delay your order.<br />
                                    <strong>C.</strong> PayPal may decline purchases due to incorrect billing addresses, low balances and purchase limits.<br />
                                    <strong>D.</strong> All transactions are subject to security reviews. PayPal reserves the right to hold payments during its investigations.</li>
